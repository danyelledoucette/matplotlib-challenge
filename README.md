Matplotlib - The Power of Plots

### Observations and Insights
- There seems to be a strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume size (0.84). This indicates that as one increases the other does as well.
- Without duplicate mice, the total number of mice tested is 248.
- Ramicane and Capomulin were tested on the greatest number of mice.
